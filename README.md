**A data cleaning done on Excel!** 

Finding a column to clean or identifying a dirty data is the first and a trickish step.

Extracting the data from the csv file to excel was the first step.  

In the process of working on it, unnecessary specialized characters were discovered. In order to get rid of these special characters, the file was opened in a google spreadsheet, saved to an excel format and reopened in the excel sheet. This took care of all unwanted specialized characters.
